In Java, a generic class is a class that can work with different data types without being rewritten for each type. Generics enable type safety and code reusability by allowing you to specify a type parameter when creating objects of the class.

âœ… Why use Generics?
- Type safety: Errors are caught at compile time
- Code reusability: Same class can be used for multiple data types
- Avoid casting: No need for type conversion
